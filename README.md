- Today's programming wisdom is: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - Donald Knuth. It reminds us that optimizing code too early in the development process can lead to unnecessary complexity, harder maintenance, and potential bugs. Instead, focus on writing clean, readable, and correct code first, and only optimize when profiling identifies performance bottlenecks.
